Pat Gelsinger: Pat Elsinger CEO of Intel thanks for having me here at the site of Intel Innovation I was tempted to to call it IDF because I remember those from a bit ago Um let's talk about the announcements here starting with uh Alder Lake
Pat Gelsinger: How close are we getting with this now that you can give more of the details to the levels of performance that you want to show
Jon Fortt: Well first John always great to have a chance to chat with you as well We're in a pretty unique spot here in San Francisco We'll be holding our innovation event inside but you know Alcatraz behind us Golden Gate Bridge This is a pretty unique spot on Earth and you know we just love the
Jon Fortt: Innovative spirit that we've seen in the Bay Area Silicon Valley all of these years and tomorrow with innovation as you say we're bringing back the spirit of IDF and we stopped that a number of years ago I helped to start it in 1997 but tomorrow it's all about the developer you know and that's the core of what we're doing here with IDF uh innovation
Jon Fortt: And uh for our time together we'll be announcing Alder Lake as you say and Alder Lake tomorrow we're releasing all of the desktop processors you know later this quarter we'll release the mobile processor family built on one overall portfolio of products you know it's based on this idea of
Jon Fortt: Both high performance and power efficient cores but also a multi tile and the ability to have one product design covering all the different segments of desktop and mobile so a very powerful capability as we go to what's called a disaggregated design and the benchmarks
Jon Fortt: Superb
Pat Gelsinger: That's what I wanted
Pat Gelsinger: wanted to get to because we're starting to see some leaked stuff on just kind of the raw performance and but not so much on the power efficiency What should we expect to see on power efficiency with the
Jon Fortt: the power efficiency we'll be giving those later this quarter most of it when we bring the mobile parts out right Desktop this is all about you know the geeks and we'll be setting some new records we hope tomorrow with
Jon Fortt: We clocking the best ever performance and gaming benchmarks that have been put forward you know from our product AMD's products Apple's anybody you know we are blowing them away when we bring out our high-end gaming capabilities and we also see with the efficient courses that we have this wonderful ability to balance between performance it's like hitting the turbo mode on your car
Jon Fortt: Versus we're in EV mode right You know all of the things and I want to have uh minimize the power requirements maximize battery life and those capabilities as well are going to be very solid over the Alder Lake product line So there's a very impressive product and all of it being done on Intel 7 you know and a couple of years ago wow we couldn't get our manual
Jon Fortt: machine running right now Intel 10 is running great Intel 7 ramping in production right now Intel 4 looking healthy so the process machine is coming back to life very well even a bit ahead of my uh let's say my audacious expectations My team's a little bit ahead of those and obviously the proof point with Alder Lake and the launch tomorrow is absolutely just a compelling way to begin innovation
Pat Gelsinger: Let's talk about cloud impact Also you're making some announcements here the partnership with Google Cloud and AI Talk about what that is going to be like and maybe how your experience at VMware dealing with cloud performance challenges and issues and talking to people in the ecosystem might influence the way this develops going forward
Jon Fortt: We're seeing this idea of the disaggregation of
Jon Fortt: Design permeating the data center as well and this idea of the CPU was in charge of everything in the past and now we see that many of these network functions when you get to cloud scale or as we'll have ainat the person in charge of all infrastructure a Google fellow will be joining us tomorrow that we're now at warehouse scale cloud computing as he calls it you know the mammothness of this and so much of the compute is being done
Jon Fortt: Managing the security the network traffic and the capabilities required and that's why this idea of a dedicated IPU or infrastructure processor unit and we've designed this with Google in a partnership with them and this has created a very exciting capability to build efficiency for clouds
Jon Fortt: Or warehouse scale as a mean likes to call it computing and it allows the data center to be more efficient CPUs are doing their application capabilities that only they can do because of the huge software requirements but you're creating this dedicated networking and security capabilities which allow the data center to be substantially more efficient
Jon Fortt: But also more secure at the same time
Pat Gelsinger: What's Intel's
Pat Gelsinger: Intel's advantage in IPUs Part of what's happening I think is the market got so used to the message that you in large part drilled into them decades ago about TikTok and you know the CPU and X86 that now that the market has changed and the narrative has to change
Pat Gelsinger: There's really a lot of doubt around well why is Intel going to win here So with IPOs specifically yeah
Jon Fortt: and the idea here is we need leading edge logic technology OK we got that right We have a leading edge cloud partner with Google We got that We have the ability also to combine some of our other assets and we're going to see that we're going to leverage some of our networking capabilities Intel's by far the number one network
Jon Fortt: Face provider in the world leading so we have a strong asset there Also we'll start leveraging our photonics capability and our silicon photonics capabilities is unquestioned the leader in the world as well And we're going to make Xons our CPUs and our IPUs work supremely well together and that allows us to leverage this huge strength to also establish this position in the IPU
Jon Fortt: But IPUs will make our Zons better so we're going to bind them together through common software layers libraries We're releasing key new software technologies It's called IPDK you know open source software and you know Nick McCune who just joined us from Stanford is leading this business area for me and as we call it the network is going soft as in software and how we establish that we think we're well positioned to create this
Jon Fortt: Disaggregated network architecture building on Zon through the software layer and yeah I think we have a lot of assets to bring to this discussion
Pat Gelsinger: Let's talk some
Pat Gelsinger: some more about software A couple of years ago you and I were tweeting at each other Intel was looking for a CEO and I said they should talk to Pat Gelsinger and you
Pat Gelsinger: you said you were oppression
Jon Fortt: oppression software
Pat Gelsinger: software is the future Um you're still saying software is the future and you've been talking about uh opening
Pat Gelsinger: APIs open source ahead of Intel innovation What is the role of software at Intel in this era and how are you going to drive it differently than it has been driven in the past
Pat Gelsinger: past
Jon Fortt: Yeah you know many aspects to this question John and as I think about it why was why did God have me outside of Intel for 11 years running a software company for 8 years and I think a lot of it was to prepare me to answer that question
Jon Fortt: Because you know it really is and you know a hardware silicon company like Intel we sort of think of software often as the afterthought Well the reality is it needs to be the forethought right because developers develop the software interfaces The software needs to come first and then the silicon needs to fit underneath those software interfaces and make it better And that's why we brought Greg onto the team my CTO at VMware to come across
Jon Fortt: And help to build that software mindset software first silicon enhanced at Intel We have 15,000 software developers I have more software developers now than I had at VMware a software company but we haven't brought them together effectively A big message as part of innovation tomorrow is delivering that unified software environment around all of the Intel platforms and we call that one API a common
Jon Fortt: Integrated environment for all of the Intel software assets everything from BIOSS to drivers to the leading edge AI capabilities one DNN you know data parallel Python some of the latest advances in parallel C and C++++ and done all in an open source way And the idea here is that there's an extraordinary amount of innovation happening in areas like AI and machine learning
Jon Fortt: And largely through open source Well our business model is a perfect complement for the open source environment So huge statements of our new offerings we're bringing together you know almost 800 new features that we're releasing with one API tomorrow So a huge amount of assets and we're really recommitting ourselves to saying developers we are back and you can trust us We're gonna be open right and we're gonna give you a choice
Jon Fortt: The core things that they're looking for for their innovation partner of the future Now that's
Pat Gelsinger: that's a
Pat Gelsinger: a lot of the near term news Now I want to talk about the medium and long term and your your turnaround plan for Intel I've described this as kind of an ocean's 11 scenario because the number of things that you have laid out that you're going to do that you say Intel has to do say over the next 5 years
Pat Gelsinger: Intel's never done things at that pace and at that scale before and frankly the street the analysts they're coming out with notes saying we don't think it can be done right so it's gonna it's gonna be really fun to watch and I'm sure it's gonna be a fun challenge for you to to you to for you to try to pull off but I wanna understand the pieces of it uh starting with
Pat Gelsinger: They all seem to be interlocking and I've been trying to study this and if you want to have the leading edge technology and the equipment from ASML and whatnot you've got to be able to have scale And if you're gonna have scale in the future you can't just be building your own designs You've got to have foundaries But if you're gonna have foundaries you gotta have leading edge process technology that
Pat Gelsinger: Has fallen behind on so you got to do these 5 process nodes in 4 years and you've got to do graphics processors and you've got to do and you've got to do I mean is that how you looked at it that you have to do all these interlocking things within a 5 year period
Jon Fortt: Well you know as we said we must get back to process leadership
Jon Fortt: And you know our process teams they kept innovating even though the manufacturing teams weren't successfully bringing them the manufacturing scale So we had you know a rich trove of ideas of innovation sitting here ready to move forward So as I looked at that it's like huh we got some pretty cool stuff ready to go I just got to unleash that you know essentially congestion that we had in our innovation machine So we essentially doubled up
Jon Fortt: We said we used to run one team right for integration We're now running 2 and they're going to go twice as fast as a result not any one of them faster but together right in harmony it's much more like TikTok process technology but
Pat Gelsinger: but TikTok was
Pat Gelsinger: was one process technology every 2 years
Jon Fortt: but it was two parallel teams in design right And that's essentially what we're creating
Jon Fortt: Our TD engine two parallel teams that are operating so the Intel 43 team sort of the top team and the Intel 20A and 18A team is sort of the tick team is they're each working in parallel on the process technologies I needed to fund them so we put more capital in place gave them the R&D capacities and what we've now laid out you know if you think about this
Jon Fortt: There are 4 major things that we're going to be able to do One is we are releasing the most innovative new transistor structure ribbon fed you know that's been done in over a decade right So a major new transistor structure Intel has led every major new transistor structure for the last 2.5 decades We're going to do it again We've laid out a new power structure with our Power via technology rebuilding the power network of the chip
Jon Fortt: You know 3rd we're embracing EUV at its core right We said boy you know we created it Uh we didn't take advantage of it initially We are all in in our ASML partnership right You know and I'm talking to Peter regularly and that team we are all in on not only EUV but what's called the 2nd generation of EUV high numerical aperture EUV and we're clearly established as the leader for that technology And 4th is our packaging
Jon Fortt: Technologies and we are unquestioned and have always been recognized as the leading package technology These four together you know what I'll be describing it's innovation is not only is Moore's Law alive and well we're committing to delivering a Moore's law for the next decade Some people have said Hey Moore's law is decaying We're saying no Moore's law is continuing for the next decade and in fact I believe we're going to be super Moore's law for the next 10 years or more and that is a profound
Jon Fortt: Statement for us and for the industry you know Moore's law alive and well for at least a decade or more
Pat Gelsinger: These are interlocking and I get that but are they dominos right If if one piece of this doesn't work out the way you plan do you end up with another one of those bottlenecks like you had with design and manufacturing that you saw when you came in
Jon Fortt: You know there's always some risk on these things but we are doing a huge amount of risk management and as I said on the earnings call and
Jon Fortt: our process technology names until 7 until 4 until 3 until 20A and until 18A all are on or ahead of schedule right and others in the industry seem to be stumbling a little bit while we are powering on maybe even a little bit faster than I would have predicted early in the year So you know there is always risk but boy the risk management that we're doing now these parallel teams that we have operating you know this is feeling pretty good
Pat Gelsinger: Um what's your focus on GPU and high performance computing and how does that fit into the full portfolio of product that you need
Pat Gelsinger: need
Jon Fortt: Yeah and we've said you know I have 6 businesses looking forward our core client business our data center business but 4 growth businesses you know accelerated computing and graphics you know networking and IPUs that we've talked about our mobility autonomy business with Moliy and
Jon Fortt: Foundry business and you know the accelerated computing business you know we're the unquestioned leaders in integrated graphics but we never expose those as discrete graphics products and this is where companies like Nvidia have done very well I mean really Nvidia
Pat Gelsinger: Nvidia has done and theses done fine too but Nvidia has become a monster on this
Jon Fortt: done very well and we just gave them that market for a decade and a half in an uncontested way that
Jon Fortt: In Q1 we're releasing products that are now getting very well received and there's been some unsanctioned rumors in the marketplace of how gamers and developers are seeing those GPU products We are showing up with a very strong product portfolio We're going to grow that into high performance computing you know as part of innovation I'm announcing that our HPC the partnership that we have with Argon National Labs we missed our target We set a goal of
Jon Fortt: Exaflop we're delivering 2 exaflops as the highest performing high-end exaflop machine that's built in the industry next year built on the same technologies Also I'm announcing the Zetta scale initiative as part of innovation and what we're going to do if you look at history it took us to go from scale to exascale computing It took 12 years
Jon Fortt: And we believe that we can do zeta scale in 5 years So that same 1000 X improvement took 12 years Tomorrow the race begins 5 years to do zeta scale computing and built on these technologies of advanced accelerated computing are leadership package technologies memory technologies silicon photonics and
Jon Fortt: Connect technologies we believe what took 12 we can get done in 5 years The race is on to Zeta and beyond
Pat Gelsinger: Uh tell me your process Your your enthusiasm is obvious but your process I'm really curious about and I want to get a little personal about because a decade plus ago a lot of people would say Intel didn't treat you right
Pat Gelsinger: Um when you're on your way out and a couple of years ago you were still saying I'm not going back to Intel at what point did you look at what Intel would have to do to get back in the fight
Pat Gelsinger: And make your calculation and say you know what
Pat Gelsinger: You know kind of like uh I don't know Doctor Strange in Endgame Like there's just one scenario that I see where this could work out and I'm gonna go back and and work on it Lots of movies I'm pulling out here You can see my taste
Jon Fortt: taste
Jon Fortt: The uh you know so in November the board reached out to me about joining the board
Jon Fortt: So I asked Michael Dell what do you think Michael He says huh they can use some help go help them And I interviewed with the board uh for a couple of weeks and then right before Christmas they said would you consider being the CEO
Jon Fortt: And you can imagine when that question was put on the table John you know it just brought back a flood right of emotions And you know the thoughts of being pushed out 11 years ago and now being considered to come back
Jon Fortt: Could I do it Do I want to do it right The role of Intel is an icon right for you know the the legacy of Gordon Andy and Robert and you know in uh innovation Tomorrow I have a piece where I interviewed Gordon Moore It's like these are the people that I grew up with you know
Jon Fortt: Invested in me and made me who I am you know Second is you know Intel is the company that puts silicon into Silicon Valley you know the foundational role that they have played for the technology industry and third is the role it plays in the economy and national security for our nation
Jon Fortt: Uh as well and as I looked at that and the stumbles that Intel has had you know the conversations with the board of directors I wrote a strategy document for the board You know someday it will probably be in the Intel museum as well and uh you know and I said if you're gonna call me I need two things One is it must be unanimous The board has to be all in because we are going on an incredible journey together
Jon Fortt: All of you need to say Pat's the guy and second you need to say that's the strategy And with that it was this unanimity because you know literally less than 45 days we laid out this new strategy to the street How do you do that in 45 days Well I already had the unanimity of the board because they said we want you to take the job Pat and we're all in on the strategy and that's allowed us to very rapid
Jon Fortt: lay out a bold strategy to pivot the company in a fundamental way to make the investments in manufacturing to rebuild our engineering proudness to reestablish the culture of the company and this journey is now getting momentum inside of the company
Pat Gelsinger: When you
Pat Gelsinger: you wrote that document did you write it
Pat Gelsinger: Knowing that that was the strategy or did you write it to figure out if there was a strategy that could work You know
Jon Fortt: it was some of both right You know and obviously as you develop a strategy document and it's like I was never that far from Intel you know in my what I call my 11 year vacation as you have it you know I was never that far right You know and you're getting all these questions people would call me people leaving people coming What do you think you know you know so you're developing
Jon Fortt: that thesis over the last several years so I clearly had a thought process in mind engaging with the board in depth around it and then in that you know it just ruined my Christmas holidays as I was studying and reading every analyst report etc Could it work Will the board have the appetite to do this What will be the effect in the marketplace you know where are these different segments Do we have the opportunity to come back
Jon Fortt: And you know as I finished that document it was like not only do I believe I'm called to do this but I believe we can do this and finally we must do this
Pat Gelsinger: On the must note I want to go to Foundry
Pat Gelsinger: That's one of the points where people are saying well Intel failed at this in the past you know didn't come with the right strategy didn't put the right resources behind it didn't structure it correctly in the organization but now there's a really interesting time where capital is pretty cheap and governments are eager
Pat Gelsinger: To have this kind of thing happen how does that set up what you think is necessary to do with Foundry
Jon Fortt: Well you know if you think about the foundry business you know there's so many aspects to this you know and I've called it Foundry makes IDM more integrated design and manufacturing better and IDM makes foundry better Now imagine that you and I were writing a startup plan John and we were going to write the Foundry startup business The first thing you need to do if you're going to be a successful foundry is to be leading edge
Jon Fortt: OK Well that's just gonna take at least $10 billion of capital per year Right More like 20
Jon Fortt: You need an R&D budget of 3 to $4 billion per year just to do the process technology
Jon Fortt: Just to get started on the process and you probably need 75,000 patents OK that's what you need to do the business And by the way Intel gives all of those to our foundry business startup
Jon Fortt: They don't pay a penny for that right I get to leverage all of that extraordinary capital R&D and you know this IP portfolio that we have That's a place that gives us huge advantage over other foundry customer other foundry in the industry because they have to pay for all that in their foundry business I get to bring that to the foundry business IDM makes IFS better but IFS also makes IDM better
Jon Fortt: And an example of that will be is we just announced our first revenue for the foundry business was Amazon You know Amazon wants to do co-design some of theirs and some of ours right And we never gave them that opportunity to say here's X86 innovate with us and your innovations next to it So we're seeing this idea of yeah we're gonna have foundry customers we're gonna have standard product customers but more so my biggest customers will be both because we're going to innovate together and that's only possible as a foundry
Jon Fortt: But we also as you say hm you know we have an unstable geopolitical situation right where you know the two major foundry providers at Leading Edge Samsung and uh uh TSMC are both in Asia
Jon Fortt: Right we've seen through COVID and the crisis of the semiconductor supply that we don't have a geographically balanced supply chain The US has gone from 39 to 12% of semiconductor manufacturing Europe from 44% to 9% You know this is a structural failure of markets and nothing is more important to the future of
Jon Fortt: Humanity than technology All technology is built on semiconductors It is that important And with that we've started this journey as we say of rebuilding of the Western semiconductor industry and the US and the European governments are now recognizing that in the face of this huge semiconductor shortage that we're in I'll say
Jon Fortt: The criticality of this if not the essentialness of this for the economy and the national security of US and European countries So we've stepped into that very aggressively and said you know we're going to put our chips on the table as I said but we want to go bigger and faster and if the governments are ready to invest in that we are ready to go bigger and faster and that will be an opportunity for our foundry business
Jon Fortt: Is to become more significant for many of the design companies in the world and we want to open the doors wide to the greatest innovation engine that's existed in the technology industry and we're going to make it available to all of those customers We structuring it the right way given the supply commitments they need and so far the demand the interest has been really quite spectacular
Pat Gelsinger: Is Foundry how you get Apple
Pat Gelsinger: Apple back
Jon Fortt: I believe I have two ways to get Apple back One is Foundry because right now they have a very limited supply chain
Jon Fortt: And if I have better process technology and I give them a capacity alternative that's pretty interesting to anybody Tim Cook he's a supply chain guy He knows how this works you know and second is build better products right If I have either of those available to them they're going to make a pragmatic decision at some point We're gonna have to work hard They're a tough customer They're very good and if we're good enough that we have better products and better process technology I'd hope to win their business at some point and everybody else in the
Pat Gelsinger: the first
Pat Gelsinger: I mean
Jon Fortt: I expect that you're
Pat Gelsinger: you're right built their business right now and their strategy on that vertical integration that you know Steve Jobs and Apple have always really seen as their as their true north They probably want to go in Foundry first and then maybe get convinced
Pat Gelsinger: convinced
Jon Fortt: probably so but you know they don't make architectural decisions quickly Those are sort of 10 year decisions at this point I hope to be founder for them much shorter than 10 years
Pat Gelsinger: We've talked about Amazon We've talked about Google
Pat Gelsinger: In the past you've mentioned Q Qualcomm as customers either for Foundry or co-design There's so much demand now if you look at those and you look at Apple for customers to be able to do their own design right for their own purposes and have it manufactured have it fit into their strategy
Pat Gelsinger: That's not the way the intel of a couple of decades ago was really focused and structured right So culturally how is Intel changing to align with that new imperative
Jon Fortt: Yeah and you know the analogy that some some have suggested I think it's actually a pretty good one It's the cultural change that Saa had to do with Microsoft right and very similar where you sort of said no we're going to we're going to innovate right We're going to keep our core values very much you know our process technology our packaging our design teams but we're going to do it
Jon Fortt: In a new open way and we're going to engage with the industry in a very different manner and this is unleashing just extraordinary change cultural dynamics inside of the company and so far it's going very well but it's not like you know these changes don't come easily as well because our process technology teams have had one customer in the past Now they have many customers right and those customer interactions are making us better
Jon Fortt: Because for instance you know Qualcomm they're much more interested in some of the power performance capabilities of the process technology and for the most part we were a powers you know performance centric company with power as a secondary factor Well they're sort of the opposite for the mobility business It's making us better
Jon Fortt: You know also many of the IP blocks that we need to create you know we're gonna be better leveraging the industry's innovation cycle than we were before makes us better you know we're also going to be more customer centric because we need to have different service mindset right to support them
Jon Fortt: You know the customers right now how do we go make it true right as well so it makes us more customer oriented as well and I'm seeing those changes on a daily basis It's a journey but I think you're gonna look back in about 2025 and you're gonna look at Intel and you're gonna say wow that's not the company that I saw in the 20 teens This is a very different company
Pat Gelsinger: Well Pat I appreciate you having me out uh to help you kick off Intel Innovation We'll be watching
Jon Fortt: Thank you so much John Always a pleasure
